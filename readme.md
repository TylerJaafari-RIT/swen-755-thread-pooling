### Large Text Sorter

Is there an evil wizard forcing you to sort every word of a large text into alphabetical order? Well, do we have the software for you!! Our software uses thread pooling to efficently sort every word in a given large text into alphabetical order. 

## Dependencies
We are only using Java libraries for this project so there should be no trouble assuming that you have some way to run Java. 

## How to run
Simply upload your large text file to this directory, then change the filename variable in threadpooler to whatever your file is named. Then, all you have to do is hit run and boom!! sorted.txt will have every word in your file sorted into alphabetical order.
